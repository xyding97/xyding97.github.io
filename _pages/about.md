About
======
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in AOS/CIMES at Princeton University working with NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). Prior to this, I got my Ph.D. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 

I am broadly interested in atmospheric circulation dynamics, with research experiences covering stratosphere-troposphere coupling, surface air temperature variability, atmospheric blocking, etc. These pursuits share a common theme: how do atmospheric dynamics contribute to weather and climate extremes? My Ph.D. work centered around the role of extreme stratospheric waves in surface cold extremes. Now I am working on subseasonal predictions using GFDL models.
